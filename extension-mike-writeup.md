##Mike's Extension over baseline

Instead of counting the number of common n-grams for each translation per reference, I counted the number of common n-grams for each translation and the entire reference corpus. I experimented with several different lengths for my n-grams and found that a range of n-grams of lengths 1 word to 9 words produced the highest-scoring output. With this combination I recieved a score of 0.571586198729 beating the baseline's score of 0.559288026529.
